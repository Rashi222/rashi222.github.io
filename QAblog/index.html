<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction:</strong></h2>
<p>In today's rapidly advancing digital age, ensuring equitable access to online content has become imperative. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) mandates inclusivity, extending its reach to encompass the digital realm. ADA testing, aligned with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), plays a pivotal role in guaranteeing that websites and applications are accessible to all users. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the profound importance of web accessibility, delve into the principles of ADA testing, examine common accessibility issues, and provide a detailed walkthrough on implementing ADA testing effectively with practical examples.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-the-significance-of-web-accessibility"><strong>Understanding the Significance of Web Accessibility</strong></h2>
<h3 id="11-inclusivity-matters"><strong>1.1. Inclusivity Matters:</strong></h3>
<p>Web accessibility is not just a development checkbox; it's a commitment to inclusivity. Imagine a visually impaired user trying to navigate a website that lacks proper contrast or alternative text. By incorporating accessible design, we create a welcoming digital environment for users with diverse abilities.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<p>Consider a website with poor color contrast. A visually impaired user using a screen reader may struggle to discern text from the background. Proper color contrast ensures that information is perceivable by all users.</p>
<p><em>One example of white text with a red background does not pass and one example with a darker red background does pass.</em></p>
<h3 id="12-legal-compliance"><strong>1.2. Legal Compliance:</strong></h3>
<p>ADA compliance is not a mere formality but a legal obligation. High-profile cases, such as Domino's Pizza facing legal consequences for an inaccessible website, underscore the importance of complying with accessibility standards.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<p>Explore the Domino's case, where the lack of accessible features led to a Supreme Court ruling, emphasizing that the ADA applies to digital platforms. The case is known as Domino’s Pizza v. Guillermo Robles, No. 18-1539.</p>
<p>In a growing trend, companies are actively addressing ADA compliance, working towards enhancing the accessibility of their applications to accommodate a broader spectrum of users. The number of lawsuits filed in federal courts alleging violations of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is decreasing from its 2021 high.  2022’s final numbers showed 24.1% fewer cases filed than in the previous year.  Thus far into 2023, the numbers are even fewer.  4,081 cases were filed between January and June of this year, representing a 17% drop from the 4,914 cases filed between January and June 2022. <a href="https://www.laborandemploymentlawcounsel.com/2023/08/2023-mid-year-report-ada-title-iii-federal-lawsuit-numbers-continue-to-decline/">Source</a></p>
<p><img alt="Alt text" src="../cases_graph-ADA.png" /></p>
<h3 id="13-expanding-audience-reach"><strong>1.3. Expanding Audience Reach:</strong></h3>
<p>Accessible websites attract a broader audience. Case studies of companies like Microsoft, which achieved increased market share after improving accessibility, demonstrate the tangible benefits of catering to a diverse user base.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<p>Microsoft's commitment to accessibility resulted in a positive impact on its brand and user loyalty. The accessible design not only expanded their audience but also improved user satisfaction.</p>

<h2 id="3-levels-in-ada"><strong>3. Levels in ADA</strong></h2>
<p>In the context of web accessibility testing, the terms "Level A," "Level AA," and "Level AAA" refer to the conformance levels defined by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). These guidelines, developed by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), provide a set of recommendations to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. The conformance levels help in specifying the level of accessibility a website or application achieves. Here's an explanation of each level:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level A</strong> (Basic Accessibility): rules with which you must comply<ul>
<li>Goal: The minimum level of accessibility to make content usable by many people.</li>
<li>Example: Make sure images have text descriptions for people who can't see them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Level AA</strong> (Standard Accessibility): rules with which you should comply<ul>
<li>Goal: A higher level that addresses more issues, making content accessible to a broader audience.</li>
<li>Example: Ensuring there's enough contrast between text and background so that everyone can read it easily.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Level AAA</strong> (Enhanced Accessibility): rules with which you may comply<ul>
<li>Goal: The highest level, providing the most comprehensive accessibility for a top-notch user experience.</li>
<li>Example: Offering sign language interpretation for videos to make content accessible to users with hearing impairments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, it's like building steps. Level A is the first step, ensuring the basics. Level AA is the second step, addressing more issues for a broader audience. Level AAA is the top step, going even further to create the best possible experience for users with disabilities. Organizations often aim for at least Level AA to strike a good balance between inclusivity and practicality.</p>
<h2 id="4-challenges"><strong>4. Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>In a healthcare domain project, we successfully attained ADA compliance. Initially, our emphasis on this aspect was limited, but as the project progressed, we recognized its significance in software development. Our goal was to achieve ADA accessibility up to level AA, and we have accomplished this with notable success. However, we have identified potential barriers to accessibility within the application. Common challenges included:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporating ADA considerations into the project during its course - We started working on ADA towards the end of the project because of which multiple things got disturbed.</li>
<li>Awareness and Education</li>
<li>Integration with the Development Process</li>
<li>Tool Selection</li>
<li>Non-descriptive alt text</li>
<li>Insufficient keyboard navigation</li>
<li>Lack of proper ARIA roles</li>
<li>Impacting users with visual and motor impairments</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-ada-testing-approach"><strong>5. ADA Testing Approach:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Accessibility Audit:</strong> Conducted a thorough accessibility audit using automated tools like Wave and manual testing using a screen reader to identify and address issues related to WCAG guidelines.</li>
<li><strong>User-Centric Testing:</strong> Engaged users with diverse disabilities in usability testing sessions to gather firsthand feedback on their experience and challenges faced.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation of Best Practices:</strong> Implemented best practices for web accessibility, including proper semantic HTML, descriptive text alternatives, keyboard navigation enhancements, and ensuring compatibility with screen readers.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Font Testing: Dynamic font in the context of ADA likely refers to a feature or practice that allows users to customize the font settings dynamically based on their preferences or needs. To test this dynamic font we need to test the font accommodation on different devices with varying screen sizes. Confirm that the font adjustments maintain responsiveness and readability across devices.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6-benefits-realized"><strong>6. Benefits Realized:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Achieved ADA compliance, mitigating legal risks and ensuring alignment with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced User Experience:</strong> Substantially improved the user experience for individuals with disabilities, fostering a more inclusive and welcoming digital environment.</li>
<li><strong>Positive User Feedback:</strong> Received overwhelmingly positive feedback from users with disabilities, highlighting the transformative impact of the accessibility improvements on their ability to navigate and engage with the application.</li>
<li><strong>Market Expansion:</strong> Opened doors to a broader user base, attracting users who prioritize applications with a commitment to accessibility and inclusive design.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="7-lessons-learned"><strong>7. Lessons Learned:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>ADA implementation should commence right from the beginning.</li>
<li>Ensuring ADA compliance for the application becomes particularly crucial when the client is based in the United States, especially within the healthcare domain.</li>

<ul>
<li>On one of our health domain projects, we performed ADA testing and got a chance to hand on it. Let me share my experience and the learning I got from there. Hope that will help you start ADA testing on your project.</li>
</ul>
<p>1) Scan the web app using the tool WAVE</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the WAVE plugin in your Chrome browser</li>
<li>Install Extension: Add the Wave accessibility extension to your browser.</li>
<li>Visit a Web Page: Go to the webpage you want to evaluate.</li>
<li>Activate Wave: Click the Wave icon in your browser toolbar.</li>
<li>Interpret Icons: Understand the red (errors), yellow (alerts), and green (features) icons.</li>
<li>Review Overlays: Identify flagged elements with visual overlays on the page.</li>
<li>Click for Details: Click on elements for detailed information and recommendations.</li>
<li>Prioritize and Address: Start with critical errors, collaborate with developers, and address issues.</li>
<li>Reevaluate Changes: Rerun Wave to ensure implemented changes resolve accessibility issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><img alt="Alt text" src="../Wave_Detail_Errors.JPG" /></p>
<p>2) Scan the app through a screen reader.</p>
<p>A screen reader is a software application that converts digital text into synthesized speech or Braille output, enabling individuals with visual impairments to access and interact with digital content. Screen readers are crucial accessibility tools that help users navigate websites, applications, and other digital interfaces by audibly presenting the content and providing spoken feedback on user actions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Familiarize yourself with common screen readers like JAWS (Job Access With Speech), NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access), and VoiceOver.</li>
<li>Turn on a screen reader (e.g., JAWS, VoiceOver) to audibly assess how users with visual impairments experience digital content.</li>
<li>Navigate with Keyboard Commands: Use screen reader keyboard commands to navigate through headings, links, and interactive elements, assessing their clarity and order.</li>
<li>Check Image Descriptions: Ensure images have descriptive alt text, allowing screen reader users to understand their content and purpose.</li>
<li>Evaluate Multimedia Content: Assess how the screen reader handles multimedia, verifying text alternatives for videos and audio elements.</li>
<li>Test Forms and Interactive Elements: Interact with forms and buttons to confirm the screen reader provides clear instructions and announcements.</li>
<li>Review ARIA Usage: Check the correct usage of ARIA roles and attributes to enhance accessibility for dynamic content.</li>
<li>Test Focus and Reading Order: Verify the logical reading order and accurate announcement of focus changes as users navigate.</li>
<li>Check for Timing and Alerts: Evaluate how the screen reader communicates time-sensitive information, such as notifications or changes on the page.</li>
<li>Navigate with Forms and Tables: Test the screen reader's ability to navigate complex components like forms, tables, and data grids.</li>
<li>Test with Multiple Screen Readers: Use different screen readers to ensure compatibility and accessibility across a diverse user base.</li>
<li>Document Findings: Document issues encountered during testing and provide recommendations for improving accessibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these two ways you can cover the AA level of accessibility for your website or app.</p>
